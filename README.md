a short idea:

Advanced Scientific Calculator (no gui)
A fully-featured command-line scientific calculator built in Python, designed to perform a wide range of basic, advanced, and trigonometric calculations with a clean user interface and robust error handling.

Key Features:
Basic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Power and Floor Division, Square Root and Factorial

Trigonometric Functions: sin, cos, tan with support for degree and radian input modes. Handles undefined cases like tan(90Â° + 180k) safely.

Inverse Trigonometric Functions: asin, acos, atan, with domain validation and results shown in degrees.

Logarithmic Functions: Supports custom base logarithms., Validates input and base to ensure mathematical correctness.

The Working of The calculator:
displays an interactive menu of operations. Users can select operations by number, name, or symbol (e.g. +, -, sin). The program maps user input to appropriate functions using Python dictionaries. 
Input is validated with clear, human-readable error messages. The app runs continuously until the user chooses to exit.

Error Handling Like:
Division by zero
Invalid input types
Domain errors (e.g., asin out of range)
All errors are caught with helpful messages, preventing crashes.

Built With:
Python 3.7
math module
Structured with modular functions and clean control flow.
